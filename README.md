OTP Verification with Twilio and Spring Boot
This Spring Boot application allows you to implement OTP (One-Time Password) verification using Twilio for sending SMS messages. It includes endpoints for sending OTPs, verifying OTPs, and supports both query parameters and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for flexibility.

Features
. Send and verify OTPs using Twilio's SMS service.
. Flexible usage with support for query parameters and DTO objects.
. Easy configuration for Twilio account details.
  Prerequisites
. Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK 8 or a higher version installed on your system.

Apache Maven: You need Maven for building and managing the Spring Boot project. Install it if you haven't already.

Twilio Account: Sign up for a Twilio account if you don't have one. You'll need the following Twilio credentials:

. account_sid: Your Twilio account SID.
. auth_token: Your Twilio authentication token.
. phone_number: A Twilio phone number from which you'll send OTP SMS messages.
. Postman: To test the endpoints, you can use Postman, a popular API testing tool. If you don't have it, you can download Postman here.

Configuration
. To set up your Twilio account details, follow these steps:

. Open the application.properties file in your Spring Boot project.

. Replace the following placeholders with your actual Twilio information:

. twilio.account_sid=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID twilio.auth_token=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN twilio.phone_number=YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
